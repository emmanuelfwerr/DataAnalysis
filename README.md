# Data Analysis Projects
This repository showcases projects completed as part of [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). A course developed in collaboration with Kaggle where I advanced my programming skills and refined my ability to work with messy, complex datasets. I learned how to manipulate and prepare data for analysis, and create visualizations for data exploration. Most importantly, I learned how to use your my skills to tell a story with data.

### Background
Hello!

My name is Emmanuel Werr and welcome to my Data Analysis repo! A little bit about me. I did my undergraduate at The Pennsylvania State University where I majored in Electrical Engineering with an emphasis on embedded systems and digital signal processing. Halfway through my college career I discovered my passion for utilizing software to build datasets that allowed me to solve problems and make cool graphs. 

I like to focus developing software for whatever problems come my way, automating my life wherever I can and conducting analysis on topics that I am passionate about!
